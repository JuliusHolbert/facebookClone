Responsive Social site allowing users to curate posts and find other users

**Technologies Used**
  • ReactJS
  • Express.JS
  • Node
  • Amazon RDS
  • SQL
  • CORS
  • React-Router
  • Sass
  • MUI Material Icons
  • Heroku

**Functionality**

Users can make posts, follow other users, change account information, upload photos, toggle between light and dark mode, delete posts, login/logout, comment, and like other users’ posts.

**How To Run:**

This code will not run because I have removed the .env file information for the AWS RDS database. The file structure is set up for a Heroku upload and normally I have separate files for the front and backend.
